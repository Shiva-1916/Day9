        Chapter 1: The rich don’t work for money Oftentimes people misunderstand
        the title of this chapter, and mistakenly believe that it means the rich
        don’t work. In fact, the complete opposite is true. Instead of reading
        the chapter title as “The Rich Don’t Work for Money”, what Kiyosaki
        means to say is that “The Rich Don’t Work for Money.” Note that by
        putting the emphasis on the word “money,” this section takes on an
        entirely different meaning. The truth is that the majority of rich
        people do work very hard, but they go about it differently than most
        people do. Rich people—and people who want to become rich—work and learn
        every day how to put money to work for them. As Rich Dad says, “The poor
        and middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.”
        Kiyosaki also notes that having a regular job is just a short-term
        solution to the long-term problem (or challenge) of creating wealth and
        financial freedom: “It’s fear that keeps most people working at a job:
        the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of
        not having enough money, and the fear of starting over. That’s the price
        of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for money.
        Most people become a slave to money—and then get angry at their boss.

        Chapter 2: Why teach financial literacy? The second chapter of Rich Dad
        Poor Dad explains the difference between an asset and a liability.
        Chapter 2 drives home the point that it’s not about how much money you
        make, but about how much money you keep. An asset is something that has
        value, that produces income or appreciates, and has a market where the
        asset can easily be bought and sold: Assets produce income Assets
        appreciate Assets do both Conversely, liabilities take money out of your
        pocket because of the costs associated with them. When Rich Dad Poor Dad
        was first published back in 1997, Kiyosaki created a lot of controversy
        with this statement. That’s because by definition, a personal residence
        isn’t an asset unless it appreciates enough to offset the costs of
        ownership. On the other hand, rental property is an asset because it can
        generate enough passive income to exceed the expenses of operating and
        financing the real estate.As Kiyosaki writes in Chapter 2 of Rich Dad
        Poor Dad, “Want to grow rich? Concentrate your efforts on buying
        income-producing assets – when you truly understand what an asset is.
        Keep liabilities and expenses low. You’ll deepen your asset column.”

        Chapter 3: Mind your own business There are 2 key messages in this
        chapter. First, pay off your debts and start investing in
        income-producing assets as soon as possible. Next, stay financially
        healthy by spending your time (instead of your paycheck) and investing
        as much of your money as possible in assets. Kiyosaki notes in Chapter 3
        of Rich Dad Poor Dad that most people confuse their profession with
        their business. In other words, they spend their entire lives working in
        somebody else’s business and making other people rich. One of my
        favorite quotes from this section is: “The primary reason the majority
        of the poor and middle class are fiscally conservative is that they have
        no financial foundation. They have to cling to their jobs and play it
        safe. They can’t afford to take risks.”

        Chapter 4: The history of taxes and the power of corporations When
        reading this chapter, it’s important to keep in mind that Kiyosaki wrote
        Rich Dad Poor Dad as a motivational book, not to provide expert
        financial or tax advice. For example, Kiyosaki writes about the time he
        bought a Porsche and treated it as a business expense, using before-tax
        dollars. Buying a high-end luxury car when a much less expensive make
        and model would do could put an investor on the fast track to an IRS
        audit. But putting the Porsche aside, the points made in this chapter
        discuss how to play the investment game smart. The rich understand the
        power of company structures and the tax code and use every legal means
        they can to minimize their tax burden. Compare how business owners and
        investors with corporations such as C corps, S corps, or LLCs pay taxes
        to how most people pay tax: Business owners with a corporate structure:
        Earn Spend Pay taxes Employees who work for corporations: Earn Pay taxes
        Spend Notice that employees who work for somebody else spend their money
        post-tax, while business owners earn and spend before paying tax.
        Chapter 4 of the book also covers the 4 main components of what Kiyosaki
        calls “Financial IQ”: Accounting, Investment Strategy, Market Law, and
        Law. As Rich Dad Poor Dad reminds us, understanding the legal and tax
        advantages significantly contribute to building long-term wealth: “For
        instance, a corporation can pay expenses before paying taxes, whereas an
        employee gets taxed first and must try to pay expenses on what is left.
        . . Corporations also offer legal protection from lawsuits. When someone
        sues a wealthy individual, they are often met with layers of legal
        protection and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing
        [in their own name]. They control everything, but [personally] own
        nothing.”

        Chapter 5: The rich invent money Inventing money means finding
        opportunities or deals that other people don’t have the skill,
        knowledge, resources, or contacts for. In Chapter 5, Rich Dad Poor Dad
        explains there are 2 types of investors: Investment packages are bought
        by people who entrust their money to a developer or fund manager. This
        is the way that most people invest, such as buying shares of an ETF or
        putting money into a real estate crowdfunding venture. Professional
        investors look after their own investments, research the market to find
        deals that make sense, then hire professionals to manage the daily
        oversight. Professional investors have 3 things in common: Identify
        opportunities that other people have not found Raise funds for
        investment Work with other intelligent people Here’s one of my favorite
        closing thoughts from this chapter: “Some people argue that there aren’t
        real estate bargains where they are, but there are prime opportunities
        everywhere that are overlooked. Most people aren’t trained financially
        to recognize the opportunities in front of them.”
